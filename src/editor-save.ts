/**
 * "Apply" — write the card to the dashboard without closing the editor
 * (issue #198).
 *
 * Home Assistant's Save closes the edit dialog. The preview beside the editor
 * is a fraction of the size of the real card, so it can't settle where an icon
 * actually lands on the plan; checking that meant saving, losing the editor,
 * looking at the dashboard, then reopening and expanding it again for the next
 * nudge. Apply does what Save does, minus the close.
 *
 * There is no public API for that, so this reaches into the dialog HA opened
 * around us: `hui-dialog-edit-card` keeps the params it was shown with —
 * including `saveCardConfig`, the callback that writes the card back into the
 * view — plus the config it currently holds. Those are internals, so nothing
 * here assumes they exist: every hop is duck-typed and a miss becomes a "use
 * Save" message rather than an exception. HA has had this shape since 2025.3;
 * before that the dialog built the new dashboard config itself, and the button
 * degrades to that message.
 *
 * The config that gets saved is the *dialog's*, never our own. A floorplan
 * nested in a vertical-stack is edited through the stack's editor, and what
 * the view must be handed back is the whole stack — our own config would
 * replace the stack with the bare floorplan.
